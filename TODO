TODO tasks for Smolder

+ Add screenshots to POD

+ Seems that when a report is deleted the directory structure of its data is still there. We need to do a better job of cleaning up.

+ Add support for dev releases to CPAN

+ get /static urls working for better caching by the browser

+ Plugins that support
  + adding and overriding templates and htdocs
  + adding sql tables
  + adding code

+ Wider UI

+ SCM revision # on the main summary page of a test run

+ Change graphs to be able to handle more data without looking crappy
  + Maybe something client side (JS, Canvas, Google graphs)?
  + add percentage based graphs

+ Custom dashboard of boxes, picking tags & showing the status for the last report of that tag

+ Handle skip-all better in the plan.
  + A skip-all plan will look like this:
    1..0 # Skip Can't reach http://google.com

  We need to show more in the report than just "No tests run". We should show the
  reason.

+ Allow anonymous uploads via smolder_smoke_signal

+ Tracking of individual tests. This would provide a view that let's
  the user see when each test was added and maybe how it has faired 
  over time. MediaWiki has an example of this:

    * HTML nested bullet list, open tags (bug 5497)    [Has never passed]
    * HTML nested ordered list, open tags (bug 5497)   [Has never passed]
    * Fuzz testing: image with bogus manual thumbnail  [Introduced
      between 08-Apr-2007 07:15:22, 1.10alpha (r21099) and 25-Apr-2007
      07:15:46, 1.10alpha]

  We'd need GUIDs (or something else) for tests so maybe we use a custom TAP diagnostic key

+ Add preference to just get plain-text emails

+ Create an interface for comparing 2 sets of reports for the same project. 
  Possibly similar to the way you select data for graphing.

+ Create a full search system of smoke reports, not just a listing
  by most recent. This would allow for searching based on project,
  status, category, etc.

+ Support new TAP diagnostics (almost specced out in TAP)

+ Support nested TAP

+ Better message stack that works arcoss sessions.

+ Precompile all templates at startup (speeds it up and increases shared memory)

+ Rendering in other browsers besides FF and KHTML

+ Import/export projects so you can move them around in smolder installs

+ Add paging to other listing pages admin_developers/admin_projects, etc (or add datagrid?)

+ Add help tooltips where appropriate

+ Allow smolder_smoke_signal to use the Smolder modules directly if it's on the same machine.

+ Add coverage reports (related to smoke tests?)

+ Add benchmark gathering?
